                                <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                    Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                    between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                    falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                    years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                    filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks
                                    of the mouse or with some minor updated information.</p>
                                <p>At the five year mark, assuming continued use of the mark, we can also help file a

                                    trademark law. This may prevent others from contesting the trademark on several
                                    common grounds, such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is
                                    confusingly similar to a mark someone else began using first; or (3) the mark is

                                    <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                        uses a
                                        company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                        pay
                                        to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                        law
                                        rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                        opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                        registered
                                        with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                        limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                        person
                                        using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                        offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                        can
                                        give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                        validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                        litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                        registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                        trademark is
                                        accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                        discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                        on
                                        notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at

                                        Wrongful
                                        use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                        name
                                        generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                        that
                                        causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                        sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                        from
                                        using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                        name
                                        is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                        the
                                        particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                        generally.
                                        Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                        new
                                        logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.
