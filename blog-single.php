                    <p>After creating a piece of intellectual property (IP), the first step is to take protective
                        measures, such as a trademark or copyright. Your business’s IP is anything you’ve made that is
                        unique and helps you stand out from the crowd. By protecting your IP, you ensure that nobody
                        else can use it for their gain.</p>
                    <p>However, registering a trademark or copyright requires additional work, causing some people to
                        choose to neglect the protective measures their businesses need. Some companies might think they
                        don’t need a trademark or copyright at all.</p>
                    <p>To help you decide if you need one of these protective measures, we’ll discuss what trademarks
                        and copyrights are, the benefits of each one, and how to get one if you choose to.</p>

                    <h2> What Are Trademarks and Copyrights?</h2>

                    <p>Trademarks and copyrights are protective measures you employ to ensure only you and those who
                        have permission can use your work. Whether you have a trademark or copyright, you have
                        protection against others using your property for monetary gain. They serve similar purposes,
                        but each one applies to different types of IP.</p>
                    <p>Trademarks cover any distinctive logo, slogan, brand, or similar identifier that people associate
                        with a business. Trademarks can apply to an entire class of products or services under a single
                        business’s umbrella.</p>
                    <p>McDonald’s distinctive logo with golden arches is an excellent example of a trademark because
                        customers immediately associate the image with the brand. Any other company that uses a similar
                        logo violates McDonald’s trademark. McDonald’s also trademarks the “I’m Loving It” phrase used
                        in some of their marketing.</p>
                    <p>Copyright applies to any tangible work you create and covers a wide range of creative works, such
                        as books, music, films, and even unique lines of code in pieces of software. However, it only
                        applies if the work is original and is available to the public via an accessible medium. A
                        concept or idea for a product or service is not copyrightable.</p>
                    <p>Common-law copyright applies as soon as you make a piece of work available. Many choose to also
                        register copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office to receive federal-level protection.</p>
                    <h2> Why Should You Get a Trademark? </h2>
                    <p> Now that you know the differences between a trademark and copyright, here are the unique
                        benefits that a trademark can offer.</p>

                    <h3>Protects Your Assets</h3>

                    <p>The logos, phrases, and identifiers you create are part of your company’s branding. They’re
                        assets that you use to advertise and build awareness with an audience. When somebody else uses
                        these identifiers, they’re using one of your assets to draw people towards their products or
                        services instead.</p>
                    <p>A trademark allows you to take action against somebody who uses one of your brand identifiers. In
                        most cases, you can raise a lawsuit against the offending party. A lawsuit can lead to the
                        receipt of monetary damages and an injunction to prevent the offender from using your work
                        again.</p>

                    <h3>Reduces the Burden of Proof</h3>
                    <p>An unregistered trademark has some protection under U.S. law. If a mark or phrase is synonymous
                        with your brand, you can still sue somebody who uses it without a registered trademark.
                        Unfortunately, the burden of proof is on your shoulders in this case. You need to demonstrate
                        that you created the unique identifier before the other party began using it and that the
                        identifier is part of your business.</p>
                    <p>By registering your trademark, you receive a document that offers definitive proof. This document
                        is often all you need to demonstrate the offense when somebody infringes on your mark. Trademark
                        registration reduces the burden of proof and the amount of time and money you’d spend on legal
                        battles.</p>
                    <h3>Prevents Other Companies From Registering the Logo or Phrase</h3>
                    <p>If you don’t register your trademark, you open the door for another business to register it. You
                        might be locked into your current geological region if somebody else registers a trademark on
                        your logo or phrase. For example, let’s say you own a store called “Jake’s Crazy Cakes” in
                        Houston, Texas and you don’t own a trademark.</p>
                    <p>If someone files a nationwide trademark for “Jacob’s Crazy Cakes,” you might be restricted from
                        where you can open other stores. Even if you decide to trademark your store later, you won’t be
                        able to prevent those who are already concurrently using it.</p>
                    <p>If you register your trademark as early as possible, you can prevent others from stealing them
                        and avoid spending money on licenses or rebranding.</p>
