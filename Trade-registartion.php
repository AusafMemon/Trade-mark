                        giving you broader protection in courts. Once registered, present yourself as an established and
                        serious business with the ® symbol after your name, logo or slogan. Other benefits include:</p>

                    <h6>Why run a search for similar marks?</h6>
                    <p>Before spending your time and money filing an application, you should do a search to see if your
                        mark is already in use or registered by someone else. A search will help avoid obvious
                        duplications of pre-existing marks. If the USPTO rejects your application, the fees to Trademark
                        Engine and the USPTO are not refundable. If your company is just beginning, it’s better to make
                        name changes now rather than invest in building a brand only to learn that you have to change
                        the name and lose all of your goodwill.<strong>All packages include a free, federal direct-hit
                            search</strong> . We also offer more comprehensive searches that will include wider searches
                        on the federal, state, common law, and global levels. Enjoy a better peace of mind while your
                        trademark application is pending with the USPTO.</p>

                                <p>One way to understand a trademark is that it is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design
                                    that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of
                                    another party. A “service” mark distinguishes the source of a service, rather than a
                                    good, but the two are typically simply referred to as a “trademark” or “mark”. In
                                    more general terms, getting a trademark protects a brand. Many of the well-known
                                    brands, logos and slogans you love, know and trust have been registered with the
                                    United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
                                <p>Generally, the registration of a trademark entitles the registrant to a presumption
                                    of ownership of the brand on a national level and a presumed right to use the brand
                                    nationwide. It may help prevent someone from registering a confusingly similar mark
                                    later and may also help the registrant bring a case in federal court if someone
                                    infringes on the brand. Once registered, a registrant can typically start using the
                                    ® symbol after the name, logo or slogan.</p>
                                <p>After a mark is properly registered and used for a five-year period, Trademark Engine
                                    can also help file a “Declaration of Incontestability.” Considered by some the
                                    greatest protection under U.S. trademark law, this may help prevent others from
                                    contesting a trademark on the following grounds: (1) the mark is not inherently
                                    distinctive; (2) it is confusingly similar to another mark that someone else began
                                    using first; or (3) the mark is simply functional as opposed to identifying the
                                    source of the goods or services.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-body">
                                    <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                        uses a company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered.
                                        So, why pay to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already
                                        exist? Common law rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the
                                        mark is used as opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a
                                        mark is registered with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can
                                        be geographically limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the
                                        other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in
                                        by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In addition,
                                        registration of a trademark can give the person holding the registered trademark
                                        a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the date of usage in later
                                        trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable
                                        remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of litigation.
                                        Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the
                                        USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the mark in the future.
                                        Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken for, which
                                        should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>

                                        Wrongful
                                        use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                        name
                                        generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                        that
                                        causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                        sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                        from
                                        using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                        name
                                        is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                        the
                                        particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                        generally.
                                        Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                        new
                                        logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                        availability of the domain name is not an indication either. A company could
                                        have a

                                        slogan and the likelihood of a trademark being approved.Using a domain name as
                                        part
                                        of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark
                                        rights. A
                                        “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is used in
                                        commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are limited
                                        to
                                        the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                        protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>
                                    <p>The geographic limitations of an unregistered mark can make it difficult to
                                        expand a
                                        business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                        could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In
                                        addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding the
                                        registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the
                                        date
                                        of usage in later trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There
                                        are
                                        also favorable remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of
                                        litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                        maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the
                                        mark in
                                        the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken
                                        for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>

                <p>In the most general sense, getting a registered trademark protects your brand. By registering a
                    trademark with the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), you will be entitled to a presumption of
                    ownership of the brand and business name on a national level and a presumed right to use it
                    nationwide. It prevents someone from registering a confusingly similar trademark after you and
                    allows you to sue in federal court if someone infringes on the brand you have worked hard to build.
                    Once you file a trademark application and register a trademark, you can present yourself as an
                    established and serious business because you can start using the ® symbol after your name, logo or
                    slogan. We can help you through this process by assisting you with your trademark application. The
                    process begins with us performing a trademark search and then creating and filing your trademark
