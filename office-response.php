                    <p>An examining attorney will issue an office action when they find an error or other legal
                        deficiency in your trademark application. The issues raised in an Office Action have to be
                        addressed or you risk the abandonment of your registration. Pursuant to your request, a Swyft
                        Legal attorney will review your office action to help you determine the best course of action
                        for your trademark registration. Whether you have a simple clerical matter to be corrected, or
                        you need a legal argument submitted, don’t delay and act today.</p>

                    <p>Over 60% of trademark applications receive Office Actions from the USPTO. Although it may seem
                        distressing, it doesn’t have to be. Many Office Actions can be cleared up with some clerical
                        fixes and agreeing to some changes proposed by the USPTO. You shouldn’t give up your application
                        because of this hurdle.</p>

                                <p>“Office Action” is the term the UPSTO uses when it has an issue or a question about a
                                    trademark application. The examining attorney within the USPTO typically sends an
                                    Office Action to notify an applicant about issues with his or her application. The
                                    letter will most often include the reason why registration is being refused or what
                                    requirements need to be satisfied. In most cases, an applicant must respond to an
                                    Office Action within three months from the date the Office Action is issued or the
                                    USPTO will abandon the application, the application fee will not be refunded, and
                                    the mark will not register. An office action may have important legal consequences
                                    and you should consider consulting with an attorney about the appropriate response.

                                    There are generally two types of office actions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li></li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                        uses a
                                        company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                        pay
                                        to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                        law
                                        rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                        opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                        registered
                                        with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                        limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                        person
                                        using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                        offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                        can
                                        give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                        validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                        litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                        registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                        trademark is
                                        accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                        discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                        on
                                        notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at
                                        least
                                        some disputes.</p>

                                        Wrongful
                                        use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                        name
                                        generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                        that
                                        causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                        sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                        from
                                        using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                        name
                                        is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                        the
                                        particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                        generally.
                                        Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                        new

                                    <p>Much like how the availability of a corporate name in a given state does not
                                        necessarily provide superior trademark rights to use the name in commerce, the
                                        availability of the domain name is not an indication either. A company could
                                        have a
                                        trademark name on a product or service, but not have acquired the domain name.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The availability of the domain name should be one part of a comprehensive search,
                                        which Trademark Engine offers, to help evaluate the strength of a brand name or
                                        slogan and the likelihood of a trademark being approved.Using a domain name as
                                        part
                                        of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark
                                        rights. A
                                        “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is used in
                                        commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are limited
                                        to
                                        the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                        protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>
                                    <p>The geographic limitations of an unregistered mark can make it difficult to
                                        expand a
                                        business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                        could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In
                                        addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding the
                                        registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the
                                        date
                                        of usage in later trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There
                                        are
                                        also favorable remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of
                                        litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                        maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the
                                        mark in
                                        the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken
                                        for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>

                                    <p>If investing heavily in a marketing campaign with a slogan, a company might

                                        registering a slogan as well. Short catch phrases or sayings that are sold as
                                        part
                                        of merchandise (like shirts or hats) can also be registered. The same rules

                                        that are applicable to picking and registering a company name. Namely, the

                                        should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary
                                        meaning.
                                        In other words, “really good pizza” probably can’t be trademarked unless that
                                        saying
                                        has become so famous that most consumers associate it with a certain pizza
