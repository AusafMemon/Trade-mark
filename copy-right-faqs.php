                                    <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                        Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                        between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                        falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                        years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                        filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks
                                        of the mouse or with some minor updated information.</p>
                                    <p>At the five year mark, assuming continued use of the mark, we can also help file a

                                        trademark law. This may prevent others from contesting the trademark on several
                                        common grounds, such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is
                                        confusingly similar to a mark someone else began using first; or (3) the mark is

                                        <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                            uses a
                                            company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                            pay
                                            to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                            law
                                            rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                            opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                            registered
                                            with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                            limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                            person
                                            using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                            offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                            can
                                            give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                            validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                            litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                            registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                            trademark is
                                            accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                            discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                            on
                                            notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at
                                            least
                                            some disputes.</p>

                                            Wrongful
                                            use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                            name
                                            generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                            that
                                            causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                            sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                            from
                                            using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                            name
                                            is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                            the
                                            particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                            generally.
                                            Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                            new
                                            logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                            of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark
                                            rights. A
                                            “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is used in

                                            the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                            protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>

                                            expand a
                                            business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                            could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In

                                            should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary

                                        Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                        between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                        falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                        years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                        filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks

                                        <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                            uses a
                                            company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                            pay
                                            to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                            law
                                            rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                            opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                            registered
                                            with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                            limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                            person
                                            using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                            offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                            can
                                            give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                            validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                            litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                            registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                            trademark is
                                            accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                            discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                            on
                                            notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at

                                            Wrongful
                                            use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                            name
                                            generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                            that
                                            causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                            sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                            from
                                            using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                            name
                                            is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                            the
                                            particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                            generally.
                                            Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                            new
                                            logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                            necessarily provide superior trademark rights to use the name in commerce, the
                                            availability of the domain name is not an indication either. A company could

                                        <p>The availability of the domain name should be one part of a comprehensive search,
                                            which Trademark Engine offers, to help evaluate the strength of a brand name or
                                            slogan and the likelihood of a trademark being approved.Using a domain name as
                                            part
                                            of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark
                                            rights. A
                                            “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is used in
                                            commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are limited
                                            to
                                            the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                            protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>
                                        <p>The geographic limitations of an unregistered mark can make it difficult to
                                            expand a
                                            business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                            could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In
                                            addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding the
                                            registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the
                                            date
                                            of usage in later trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There
                                            are
                                            also favorable remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of
                                            litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                            maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the
                                            mark in
                                            the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken
                                            for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>

                                    <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                        Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                        between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                        falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                        years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                        filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks

                                        <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                            uses a
                                            company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                            pay
                                            to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                            law
                                            rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                            opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                            registered
                                            with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                            limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                            person
                                            using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                            offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                            can
                                            give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                            validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                            litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                            registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                            trademark is
                                            accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                            discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                            on
                                            notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at

                                            Wrongful
                                            use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                            name
                                            generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                            that
                                            causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                            sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                            from
                                            using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                            name
                                            is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                            the
                                            particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                            generally.
                                            Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                            new
                                            logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                            of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark

                                            the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide

                                            could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In

                                            consider
                                            registering a slogan as well. Short catch phrases or sayings that are sold as
                                            part
                                            of merchandise (like shirts or hats) can also be registered. The same rules
                                            apply
                                            that are applicable to picking and registering a company name. Namely, the
                                            slogan
                                            should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary
                                            meaning.
                                            In other words, “really good pizza” probably can’t be trademarked unless that
                                            saying
                                            has become so famous that most consumers associate it with a certain pizza
                                            brand.
