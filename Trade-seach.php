                    <h6>Why run a search for similar trademarks?</h6>
                    <p>Before spending your time and money filing an application you should do a search to see if your
                        mark is already in use or registered by someone else. A search will help avoid obvious
                        duplications of pre-existing marks. If the USPTO rejects your application, the fees to Trademark
                        Engine and the USPTO are not refundable. If your company is just beginning, itâ€™s better to make
                        name changes now rather than invest in building a brand only to learn that you have to change
                        the name and lose all of your goodwill.</p>

                    <h6>What concerns should I have with my name or logo?</h6>
                    <p>Even if you have a domain name or incorporated your name, you can still run into trouble if your
                        name is too similar to someone else's. In fact, the most common basis for rejection is that your
                        name is too similar to one already registered with the USPTO. A similar name is not an automatic
                        bar for unrelated products or services because the test is whether a consumer is likely to be
                        confused.</p>
