                    <p> <strong>Maintain Your Mark</strong>  - Extend your trademark rights to ensure continuous brand protection.</p>
                    <p> <strong>Prevent Expiration</strong>  - Keep your trademark alive by letting the USPTO know it’s still in use.</p>

                                            <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                                Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                                between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                                falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                                years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                                filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks
                                                of the mouse or with some minor updated information.</p>
                                            <p>At the five year mark, assuming continued use of the mark, we can also help file a
                                                “Declaration of Incontestability,” which provides additional protection under
                                                trademark law. This may prevent others from contesting the trademark on several
                                                common grounds, such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is
                                                confusingly similar to a mark someone else began using first; or (3) the mark is

                                                <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                                    uses a
                                                    company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                                    pay
                                                    to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                                    law
                                                    rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                                    opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                                    registered
                                                    with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                                    limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                                    person
                                                    using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                                    offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                                    can
                                                    give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                                    validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                                    litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                                    registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                                    trademark is
                                                    accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                                    discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                                    on
                                                    notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at
                                                    least

                                                    Wrongful
                                                    use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                                    name
                                                    generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                                    that
                                                    causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                                    sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                                    from
                                                    using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                                    name
                                                    is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                                    the
                                                    particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                                    generally.
                                                    Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                                    new
                                                    logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                                    commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are limited
                                                    to
                                                    the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                                    protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>
                                                <p>The geographic limitations of an unregistered mark can make it difficult to

                                                    business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                                    could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In
                                                    addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding the
                                                    registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the
                                                    date
                                                    of usage in later trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There

                                                    litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                                    maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the

                                                    the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken
                                                    for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>
