                                <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                    Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually due
                                    between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                    falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every ten
                                    years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                    filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few clicks
                                    of the mouse or with some minor updated information.</p>
                                <p>At the five year mark, assuming continued use of the mark, we can also help file a
                                    “Declaration of Incontestability,” which provides additional protection under
                                    trademark law. This may prevent others from contesting the trademark on several
                                    common grounds, such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is
                                    confusingly similar to a mark someone else began using first; or (3) the mark is

                                    <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when someone
                                        uses a
                                        company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So, why
                                        pay
                                        to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist? Common
                                        law
                                        rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used as
                                        opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                        registered
                                        with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be geographically
                                        limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                        person
                                        using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else who
                                        offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a trademark
                                        can
                                        give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                        validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                        litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available to
                                        registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                        trademark is
                                        accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which can
                                        discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should be
                                        on
                                        notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid at
                                        least

                                        Wrongful
                                        use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos. Trademarking a
                                        name
                                        generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the name
                                        that
                                        causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique logo.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                        sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents others
                                        from
                                        using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a company
                                        name
                                        is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name in
                                        the
                                        particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                        generally.
                                        Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for the
                                        new
                                        logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name changes.

                                    <p>Much like how the availability of a corporate name in a given state does not
                                        necessarily provide superior trademark rights to use the name in commerce, the
                                        availability of the domain name is not an indication either. A company could
                                        have a
                                        trademark name on a product or service, but not have acquired the domain name.

                                    <p>The availability of the domain name should be one part of a comprehensive search,
                                        which Trademark Engine offers, to help evaluate the strength of a brand name or
                                        slogan and the likelihood of a trademark being approved.Using a domain name as
                                        part
                                        of a brand that sells goods or services may establish common law trademark
                                        rights. A
                                        “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is used in
                                        commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are limited
                                        to
                                        the geographic area where the mark is actually used as opposed to the nationwide
                                        protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.</p>
                                    <p>The geographic limitations of an unregistered mark can make it difficult to
                                        expand a
                                        business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic area
                                        could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark. In
                                        addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding the
                                        registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and the
                                        date
                                        of usage in later trademark infringement litigation, if it comes to that. There
                                        are
                                        also favorable remedies available to registered trademark owners in the event of
                                        litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                        maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the
                                        mark in
                                        the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already spoken
                                        for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>

                                        registering a slogan as well. Short catch phrases or sayings that are sold as

                                        of merchandise (like shirts or hats) can also be registered. The same rules

                                        that are applicable to picking and registering a company name. Namely, the

                                        should be inherently distinctive and creative or have developed a secondary
