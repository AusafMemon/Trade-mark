                   <h6>About Trademark Engine</h6>
                   <p>Trademark Engine began as the brainchild of a lawyer and technologists who recognized the need for a trademark filing service for independent consumers and small businesses. Understanding that many entrepreneurs don’t need or can’t afford a full-service intellectual property attorney, our founders strove to create an efficient, affordable, and understandable process that allows anyone to obtain a trademark for their business.

                   </p>
                   <p>Although Trademark Engine is not a law firm and doesn’t provide legal advice, we can equip you with the power to obtain your own trademark. Our customer service team consists of dedicated trademark representatives with a shared goal — meeting customer needs in a friendly, caring, and efficient manner.</p>
                   <p>Our team guarantees a streamlined process supported by experienced helpers that can help if you have questions. We stress that our services are not appropriate for those seeking bespoke legal services, but for those who need it, our team is ready to support your trademark registration needs.</p>

Everyone is really helpful, and management truly has an open-door policy, which is awesome! Your concerns, suggestions, and comments are not only heard but also taken into consideration. They have great benefits like medical, dental, vision, and life insurance. And they never fail to give you great kudos for a job well done, which is great motivation to continue doing your best.”</p>
