                                    <p>Once properly registered, trademarks generally need to be renewed by filing a
                                        Declaration of Continued Use. The first Declaration of Continued Use is usually
                                        due
                                        between the 5th and 6th anniversary date of the filing. The next renewal usually
                                        falls between the ninth and tenth year. Thereafter renewals are generally every
                                        ten
                                        years. Trademark Engine provides notice of the applicable deadlines and allows
                                        filing of the necessary paperwork via its personalized portal with just a few
                                        clicks
                                        of the mouse or with some minor updated information.</p>
                                    <p>At the five year mark, assuming continued use of the mark, we can also help file
                                        a
                                        “Declaration of Incontestability,” which provides additional protection under
                                        trademark law. This may prevent others from contesting the trademark on several
                                        common grounds, such as: (1) the mark is not inherently distinctive; (2) it is
                                        confusingly similar to a mark someone else began using first; or (3) the mark is

                                        <p>Under U.S. law, a “common law trademark” is generally established when
                                            someone
                                            uses a
                                            company name, logo or slogan in commerce, even if it is not registered. So,
                                            why
                                            pay
                                            to register a trademark when a common law trademark may already exist?
                                            Common
                                            law
                                            rights ordinarily are limited to the geographic area where the mark is used
                                            as
                                            opposed to the nationwide protection customarily obtained when a mark is
                                            registered
                                            with the USPTO. So, unless registered, the use of a mark can be
                                            geographically
                                            limited, which hampers the ability to expand the brand. On the other hand, a
                                            person
                                            using a mark in a limited geographic area could be boxed in by someone else
                                            who
                                            offensively registers a similar mark. In addition, registration of a
                                            trademark
                                            can
                                            give the person holding the registered trademark a leg up in court as to the
                                            validity of the mark and the date of usage in later trademark infringement
                                            litigation, if it comes to that. There are also favorable remedies available
                                            to
                                            registered trademark owners in the event of litigation. Finally, once a
                                            trademark is
                                            accepted by the USPTO, it will be maintained in the USPTO database, which
                                            can
                                            discourage others from using the mark in the future. Future companies should
                                            be
                                            on
                                            notice that the mark is already spoken for, which should in turn help avoid
                                            at
                                            least

                                        <p>There may be advantages to registering both a name and an associated logo.

                                        <p>A more budget-friendly option could involve registering just a company name.
                                            Wrongful
                                            use of names seems to be more common than wrongful use of logos.
                                            Trademarking a
                                            name
                                            generally provides broader protection because it prevents any use of the
                                            name
                                            that
                                            causes confusion, even if someone tries to use the name within a unique
                                            logo.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>A mark for a logo typically protects the shape, orientation, stylization and
                                            sometimes color in that particular logo. Registering ordinarily prevents
                                            others
                                            from
                                            using that logo or something confusingly similar to the logo. Even if a
                                            company
                                            name
                                            is in the logo, registering the logo may only protect the use of that name
                                            in
                                            the
                                            particular way it is used in the logo and not the use of the name more
                                            generally.
                                            Moreover, amended or redesigned logos usually require a new application for
                                            the
                                            new
                                            logo. As may be expected, logo changes seem to be more common than name
                                            changes.

                                            rights. A
                                            “common law” trademark can be established when a name, logo or slogan is

                                            commerce, even if it is not registered. Common law rights, however, are
                                            limited
                                            to

                                            protection typically established by registration of a mark with the USPTO.

                                            business. On the other hand, a person using a mark in a limited geographic
                                            area
                                            could be boxed in by someone else who offensively registers a similar mark.
                                            In
                                            addition, registration of a trademark customarily gives the person holding

                                            registered trademark a leg up in court as to the validity of the mark and

                                            litigation. Finally, once a trademark is accepted by the USPTO, it should be
                                            maintained in the USPTO database, which can discourage others from using the
                                            mark in
                                            the future. Future companies should be on notice that the mark is already
                                            spoken
                                            for, which should in turn help avoid at least some disputes.</p>
